Problem Statement
There is a scenario where thousands of loans are flowing into one store, assume any way of
transmission of Loans. We need to create a one loan store, which store the loans in the following
order


| Loan ID | Customer Id | Lender Id | Amount | Remaning Amount | Payment Date | Interest per day(%) | Due date   | Penalty/Day  (%Day) | Cancel |
|---------|-------------|-----------|--------|-----------------|--------------|---------------------|------------|---------------------|--------|
| L1      | C1          | LEN1      | 10000  | 10000           | 05/06/2023   | 1                   | 05/07/2023 | 0.01%               |        |
| L2      | C1          | LEN1      | 20000  | 5000            | 01/06/2023   | 1                   | 05/08/2023 | 0.01%               |        | 
| L3      | C2          | LEN2      | 50000  | 30000           | 04/04/2023   | 2                   | 04/05/2023 | 0.02 %              |        | 
| L4      | C3          | LEN2      | 50000  | 30000           | 04/04/2023   | 2                   | 04/05/2023 | 0.02 %              |        |

There are couple of requirement/validation
1. The payment date canâ€™t be greater than the Due Date. If its greater we have to reject the
   Loan and thrown the exception
2. We need to write an aggregation on the remaining amount, Interest and Penalty Group by
   Lender, Group by Interest and Group by Customer ID.
3. If the Loan crosses the due date, it should write an alert in the log message.
